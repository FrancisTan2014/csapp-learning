# Practice Problem 2.48 (solution page 159)
As mentioned in Problem 2.6, the integer 3,510,593 has hexadecimal representation 0x00359141, while the single-precision floating-point number 3,510,593.0 has hexadecimal representation 0x4A564504. Derive this floating-point representation and explain the correlation between the bits of the integer and floating-point representations.

## My answer
```c
    // The bit representation of number 3,510,593,
    // the former one is for integer type while the 
    // latter one represents the float type.
    00000000001 101011001000101000001
      010010100 101011001000101000001 00
